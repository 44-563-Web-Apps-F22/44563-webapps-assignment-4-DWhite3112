        <h2>Princess IDA</h2>
        <h3>ACT II
            SCENE        Gardens in Castle Adamant.  A river runs across the
                         back of the stage, crossed by a rustic bridge.  Castle
                         Adamant in the distance.
          
                         Girl Graduates discovered seated at the feet of Lady
                              Psyche
        </h3>
        <p> 
            <p>(Enter Lady Blanche.  All stand up demurely)</p>

            <h4>Blanche:</h4>     
                      <p>Attention, ladies, while I read to you
                         The Princess Ida's list of punishments.
                         The first is Sacharissa.  She's expelled!
                         </p>
          
            <h4>All:</h4>         
                      <p>Expelled!</p>
          
            <h4>Blan.:</h4>                  
                      <p>Expelled, because although she knew
                         No man of any kind may pass our walls,
                         She dared to bring a set of chessmen here!
                         </p>
          
            <h4>Sach.:</h4>       
                      <p>(Crying)  I meant no harm; they're only men of wood!</p>
          
            <h4>Blan.:</h4>       
                      <p>They're men with whom you give each other mate,
                         And that's enough!  The next is Chloe.
                        </p>

            <h4>Chloe:</h4>                                                     
                      <p>Ah!</p>
          
            <h4>Blan.:</h4>       
                      <p>Chloe will lose three terms, for yesterday,
                         When looking through her drawing-book, I found
                         A sketch of a perambulator!
